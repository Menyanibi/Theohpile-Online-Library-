<pre>
The road was long and winding,
As I journeyed through the night.
But I found solace in the darkness,
And the stars shone bright.

I walked alone, but not alone,
For the earth was my companion.
And the whisper of the wind,
Brought peace to my heart again.

Now I rest beneath the trees,
And listen to the birdsong sweet.
For the journey may be over,
But the memories will always keep.
